# Deploying apps to App Store and Google store

Notes taken from: [Flutter Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8&t=29s)

Every application has an **identifier** which contains:

- **domain name** (almost like a website `com.myname.myappname`)



## iOS

- Using a simulator for development
- Using a real iPhone but requires an Apple Developer Account ($)



## Android

- Android emulator for development 
- Using a real android device is easier than apple and free
- But: to submit an application to Google for review, still requires developer account

# Dev Account

- It is an account that gives extra resources to be able to test and deploy respective apps to respective stores.
- Types of accounts:
  - **Individual account**
  - **Company account**
  - Difference:
    - Liability (individual responsibility vs company's responsibility) - important for legal issues, privacy issues, etc.
