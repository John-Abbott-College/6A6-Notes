## Authentication

Authentication is the process of validating the identity of a registered user or process before providing access to protected resources, networks or systems. It often involves validating credentials against an authority. It is a well studied problem in the domain of information security. Many protocols have been developed to standardize the process.

`OAuth` is an **open protocol** to allow **secure authorization** in a **simple** and **standard** method from web, mobile and desktop applications. It enables sharing data across APIs without having to share a password. As matter of fact, `OAuth` 2.0 is the industry protocol for authorization. It allows a user to grant limited access to its protected resources.

Many APIs use `OAuth` to provide authentication services to programmers to be able to build app with ease. Here are some of the common APIs that use OAuth:

- Firebase by Google.
- Azure Authentication by Microsoft.
- Auth0 (https://auth0.com/)
