## Objectives

In this lab, we will attempt to add navigation to the Maui Social Media App, add photo pickers, save the user preferences and use an API to save images. 

- Add flyout and tab bar navigation 
- Use application preferences
- Add and use embedded text files



## Setup

- Accept the Github classroom assignment :

  - [Section 1](https://classroom.github.com/a/VkZFIBNE)
  - [Section 2](https://classroom.github.com/a/GFAeEFHi)

  



## Exercise 1 - Flyout Menu

As an inspiration, we will be using Instagram's layout to add navigation as such:

1. Add the `./Views` folder to the `AppShell.xaml` namespace:

   ```xml
   <Shell
       x:Class="DemoNavigation2.AppShell"
       xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
       xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
       xmlns:local="clr-namespace:DemoNavigation"
       xmlns:views="clr-namespace:DemoNavigation.Views">
   ```

   This will enable us to refer to the views folder from within xaml

2. Add the pages below to the `ShellContent` in the `AppShell` :

   - Groups 
   - Info 
   - Settings

3. Notice that the `Route` property must be changed for each added page.

4. Add an icon to each flyout item to obtain the following results:

   <img src="images/maui_navigation/flyout_1.png" Height="300" class="inline-img"/>

5. Add a flyout item which will act as a button to switch between dark/light mode:

   ```xml
   <MenuFlyoutItem Text="Switch Theme"  Clicked="Btn_SwitchTheme_Clicked"/>
   
   ```

6. Add the even handler in the `AppShell.xaml.cs`

   ```csharp
   private void Btn_SwitchTheme_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
   {
   
       switch (App.Current.UserAppTheme)
       {
           case AppTheme.Light:
               App.Current.UserAppTheme = AppTheme.Dark;
               break;
           case AppTheme.Dark:
               App.Current.UserAppTheme = AppTheme.Light;
               break;
           default:
               App.Current.UserAppTheme = AppTheme.Light;
               break;	
       }
   }
   
   ```

### Exercise 2 - Tab Bar 

To combine the flyout menu and the tab bar, each `ShellContent` you wish to display in the `Flyout` should be wrapped within a `FlyoutItem` **instead of the `TabBar`** and keep the `ShellContent` you wish to keep in the Flyout as direct children of the `Shell`



1. Modify the `AppShell` to create the following strucutre:

   ```text
   - Home
     - MainPage
     - SearchPage
     - NewPost (tab)
     	- SelectPhotos
     	- CameraPage
     - Videos
     - ProfilePage
   - Groups
   - Info
   - Settings
   ```

   

## Exercise 3 - App Preferences

You will have to complete the `Settings.xaml` page functionality in order to save three user preferences and then use them to define the Username displayed in `ProfilePage.xaml` and set the `App.Current.UserAppTheme`:

| Preference name | Type     |
| --------------- | -------- |
| "`username`"    | `string` |
| `"apptheme"`    | `bool`   |

**Setting preferences**

1. Inspect the `Settings.xaml` file and note the `TableView`'s content, these are the entries where the user can set their preferences.
2. In `Settings.xaml.cs`, implement the event handlers to set each of the preference listed above

> To set a preference use `Preferences.Set("nameofthepreference", value);`

3. For the `AppTheme` inspect the `MenuFlyoutItem` and its event handler added to the `AppShell.xaml.cs` to know how to get the current app theme.
4. In addition to saving the new preference, you should set the app theme to Light if the toggle is on, and set it to Dark if the toggle is off.

**Using preferences**

3. Restart the app to test the next few steps
4. Inside the `Settings.xaml.cs` page constructor, get the preferences saved to set the entries text and the toggle switch state. 

> To get a preference use
>
> `Preferences.Get("nameofthepreference", defaultvalue);`

5. Get the preference of the theme to set the App theme inside the `AppShell.xaml.cs`
6. Get the preference of the username and the user profile to set the username and profile picture inside the `ProfilePage.xaml.cs` and inside the `CommentsPage.xaml.cs`

 **‚ú® Test your understanding** Is it possible to serialize an object inside the Preferences?

## Exercise 4 - Reading an embedded file

1. Create a text file and save it as  `Files/InfoText.txt`, we will use it as an embedded file. 

2. You can write a short description of the app or have Chat Gpt write some text.

3. The`Info.xaml`will serve as a placeholder for a static text contained in this file

4. Open your `MSBuild` file (`.csproj` file, you can open by double clicking the name of the project and add the file as an `EmbeddedResource`

5. Implement the private method `LoadFile()`, open the embedded file and 

   > Hint: Use the `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceNames()` and `GetManifestResourceStream()` methods.	

6. Using a `StreamReader`, read the content of the file

7. Set the `FileEditor.Text` to the content of the file.

8. Call the method in the constructor of the `Info` page

9. Display its content in the Editor



 **‚ú® Test your understanding**   What other files are included as embdedded files?
